# QuantumDBSearch-GroversAlgorithm
A quantum algorithm used to accelerate database searches.

# WHY:

So, in middle school I actually wanted to become a quantum physicist. Around that time my love for computer science also bloomed. So naturally, quantum computing became a field for me to look into. I've been interested in quantum computing for a while, and I've actually been taking Brilliant Courses for Quantum Computing to prepare myself for this project.


# WHAT:

## What is Quantum Computing: 

Quantum Computing is a form of computing designed to tackle problems that are similar to quantum mechanics solutions. Some problems are easier to map onto quantum mechanics like quantum simulations, others are harder to map onto quantum mechanics like convential data sorting & searching algorithms. These are places where the problem doesn't naturally align with quantum principles. And therefore isn't ideal to map to quantum mechanics. But I'm going to attempt it using an algorithm designed by Lov Kumar Grover called Grover's algorithm. He was born in 1961 and designed the algorithm in 1996.

## Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can search for an item within a group of elements in O(âˆš N) time. For reference, classical computers ususally take O(N) time, as they need to search the entire group to see the whole thing.

## What I'm trying to do:
So the goal is to try and implement this algorithm to try and optimize database query searches.
